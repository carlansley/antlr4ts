## Requirements

This project has separate requirements for developers and end users.

> :bulb: The requirements listed on this page only cover user scenarios - that is, scenarios where developers wish to
> use ANTLR 4 for parsing tasks inside of a TypeScript application. If you are interested in contributing to ANTLR 4
> itself, see [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for contributor documentation.

### End user requirements

Parsers generated by the ANTLR 4 TypeScript target have a runtime dependency on the
[antlr4ts](https://www.npmjs.com/package/antlr4ts) package. The package is tested and known to work with Node.js 6.7.

### Development requirements

The tool used to generate TypeScript code from an ANTLR 4 grammar is written in Java. To fully utilize the ANTLR 4
TypeScript target (including the ability to regenerate code from a grammar file after changes are made), a Java Runtime
Environment (JRE) needs to be installed on the developer machine. The generated code itself uses several features new to
TypeScript 2.0.

* Java Runtime Environment 1.6+ (1.8+ recommended)
* TypeScript 2.0+

## Getting started

### Dev setup - for develping ANTLR4 code targeting TypeScript/JavaScript/CoffeeScript from 
    - [Node.js Version 6.x or greater](https://nodejs.org/en/)
    - After installing Nodejs, be sure you have the latest node package manager to the latest with the command `npm i -g npm`
    - You may install the latest stable antlr4ts command globally with the command `npm install -g antlr4ts-cli`.
    - You may install a antlr4ts command into your project with `npm install --save-dev antlr4ts-cli`.   
    - You may install the antlr4ts runtime into your project with `npm install --save antlr4ts`.  

Note: this package has a development time dependency on the [Java Runtime Environment (JRE)](https://java.com/en/download/), or a [Java Development Kit (JDK)](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html).   These are only required on your development machine, there is no dependency on Java at runtime.
